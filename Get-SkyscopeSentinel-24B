Install and test out the incredible capabilities our model has to offer such as default capabilities we trained into our model which include:
* Multi Agentic Co-Op implementation as a default
* Ability to simulate a team of experts using it's own best logic determined by context of user requirements [Task/Project specific]
* Ability to utilize/leverage tools, perform web search, RAG, and numerous other capabilities without having to ask - This ensures any task or project it is given is achieved for the user to completion as specified/requested or if able to do so without any additional context requesting it to do so - it will aim to by default exceed users expectations to it's full capacity/capability.
